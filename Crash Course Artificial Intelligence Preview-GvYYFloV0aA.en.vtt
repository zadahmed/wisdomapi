Hi! I’m Jabril, and welcome to Crash Course Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.940
Whether we notice it or not, artificial intelligence
is EVERYWHERE.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.470
It’s guiding critical decisions in every
field, from finance to health.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.940
It’s driving the algorithms of technology
giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.500
And it’s what puts the “smart” in our
smart devices like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.100
Artificially intelligent systems are analyzing
/huge/ amounts of data that we’re generating

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.259
every day, to infer patterns and predict likely futures.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.120
Like the amount of yogurt people might buy next week at the grocery store,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.260
so the store knows how much to stock.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.900
Everyone seems to be talking about AI and
how it’s going to revolutionize the world

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.860
or create some dystopian future.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.500
While we don’t know what the future
holds, we at Crash Course believe that creating

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.670
a better outcome starts with a better understanding.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.960
The goal of this course is to teach the logic behind AI by tracing its history, examining

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.140
how it’s being used today, and showing some practical examples.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.540
And we’re going to try something a little
different, we’ll work together on labs,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.280
writing and implementing code to program our
very own AI systems!

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.720
Along the way, we’ll spend several episodes
on a hot area of AI known as machine learning.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.460
Using the brain as inspiration, these
AI can learn from examples.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.340
We’ve taught machines to recognize people
in photos, predict the next word we’re going

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.470
to type on our phones, and recommend videos
for us on YouTube!

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.000
But AI is broader than just machine learning.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.210
So we’ll talk about how AI systems
can act based on plans, rules, and logical

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.920
representations of the world.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.640
These are the kinds of algorithms that are
used to plan the path of a delivery-drone

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.960
or determine the best move in a game of chess.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.880
But before we get into all the technical stuff, I should introduce myself.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.500
I’m your human-host, Jabril!

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.640
I have a YouTube channel called Jabrils, where
I look for interesting problems, be it personal

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.810
or universal, try to solve them using code,
and vlog my adventures and mistakes along

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.500
the way!

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.540
I got my start in machine learning when I
decided to build a machine learning game from

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.540
scratch.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.229
I didn’t have any prior knowledge on the
subject, which I think ended up helping it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.439
resonate with people.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.860
Now I’m hosting Crash Course AI, and I’m
not doing it alone!

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.640
John Green Bot?

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.700
This is my non-human sidekick, John-Green-bot, who will help me demonstrate some core ideas and show

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.799
the limits and possibilities of current AI.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.340
John Green Bot: Greetings, human viewers.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.580
Now, I’m excited to learn about AI, I because I want to be able to go to new cities &amp; be

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.120
guaranteed to get the type of pizza that I
think is tastiest, not necessarily what’s most popular.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.360
Or when I go to the doctor, I could get a
prescription specifically tailored to me and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360
my exact symptoms. With AI this type of future is possible.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.219
AI is still a new field, so there are a lot
of problems to solve but not that many people

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.769
trying to solve them.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.739
We also have to think about what the future
of AI means for us as humans, &amp; I believe

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.749
it’s in our best interest to have as many
people as possible who understand the field of AI

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.920
so that the conversation can expand.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.239
Thanks for watching.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.900
And as they say in John Green Bot’s hometown…

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.069
John Green Bot: Don’t Forget To Be Blossom!

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.760
No.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.720
John Green Bot.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.660
AWESOME.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.960
Don’t forget to be AWESOME.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.160
We’ll see you guys next week!

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.939
